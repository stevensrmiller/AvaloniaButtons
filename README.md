# AvaloniaButtons
 Simple Buttons in C# with no XAML.

 Download the zip file into an empty directory and
 unzip the two files: Button.cs and Button.csproj.

 Then, enter the dotnet run command. Click on the
 buttons to see it draw rectangles or ellipses.

 If you have any trouble with the zip file, open
 each file in your web browser, click "raw," then
 copy and paste the contents of each file into a
 file of the same name on your computer. Then use
 the dotnet run command.
